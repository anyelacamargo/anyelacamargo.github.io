## [Fitting growth curves](fitGrowthCurves.html)

- Fit growth curves Gompertz, logistic y 4-param logistic
- Data from Paine et. al. Best practice for growth analysis: model implementations and growth rate calculations to foster ecological inference.
 
## [Logistic Regression on Markov Chains for Failure detection](challengerBayesian.html)

- We use data logistic regresion to predict the probability of o-ring failure given to temperature.
- A Metropolis-Hastings is used the maximise the likelyhood of the parameters alpha and beta in the logistic model
